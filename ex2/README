REMARKS:


ANSWERS:
1.Music player: in this example we have the main thread for handling the UI and few other user-level that handle the
    music playback or downloading track info.

2. advantages:
    The Performing operation in one tab won't disrupt other tab performance.
    Communication is more secure. A website crashing in one of the tabs won't crash the whole application.

    disadvantages:
    switching tabs is heavy, in case they are implemented with processes(required kernel mode).
    lack of efficiency: if more then one tab uses same source - they will be loaded multiple times.

3. After typing 'kill <pid>' in the shell terminal using the keyboard (which in turn sends hardware interrupts to the
 CPU with the appropriate key codes) and pressing Enter (which again sends a hardware interrupt) -
 the linux shell makes a system call to the process with the SIGTERM signal.
 This specific signal is captured by the process and the process quits unconditionally.

4. Real time - the time of the "physical world" which is stored inside the RTC module inside the BIOS microchip.
    Virtual time - the uptime of the application (process).
